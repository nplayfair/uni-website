		<p>Thom Yorke is the lead singer, guitarist and main songwriter for the band. He was born in Northamptonshire on the 7th of October 1968 and eventually moved to Oxfordshire where he met the other members of the band and went to school with them. They formed a band which was first called <em>On A Friday</em>, so called because that was the only time they could rehearse together.</p>
		<p>Thom got his first guitar when he was only 7 years old and had already joined a band by the time he was 11. He often plays guitar on Radiohead tracks, along with Johnny Greenwood and has also played piano and bass guitar on several tracks.</p>
		<p>He is notable for having a drooping left eye, which was fixed shut when he was born and since underwent several operations to correct it which has lead to his distinctive appearance.</p>
		<p>In 2006, Thom released his first solo album <em>The Eraser</em> which he performs the vocals and used more beats and electronic music than he normally does with Radiohead. The album was highly sucessful reaching number 3 in the UK charts and number 2 in the United States, Canada and Australia. He received a nomination for a Grammy award for the Best Alternative Music Album for <em>The Eraser</em> in 2007.</p>

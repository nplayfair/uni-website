		<p>Jonny Greenwood (full name Jonathan Richard Guy Greenwood) was born on the 5th of November 1971 and is the younger brother of fellow bandmate Colin Greenwood. He plays many instruments and mainly plays lead guitar and keyboard for Radiohead.</p>
		<p>He has written a number of songs for the band including <em>The Tourist</em>, <em>Kid A</em>, <em>Idioteque</em>, <em>Life in a Glasshouse</em> and <em>A Wolf at the Door</em>.</p>
		<p>Jonny is the only member of the band to be a classically trained musician. When he was younger, he took viola lessons which is one of the many instruments he is capable of playing. Other instruments that he can play, some of which he has played on Radiohead tracks include the xylophone, glockenspiel, harmonica and drums.</p>
		<p>He is a big fan of classical music and jazz and cites Miles Davis as one of his major influences. He is responsible for many of the classical elements that often feature in Radiohead songs and he also serves as a composer for the BBC.</p>

		<p>	At the band’s insistence, their iTunes tracks are in a higher audio quality than most files on the store. The tracks are also free from copying restrictions, so they can be played on almost any digital device and shared on the web. The full album comes with a free podcast and a 15-page digital “booklet”.</p>

	<p>Radiohead cut a deal with iTunes after leaving EMI, their long-term record company, in acrimonious circumstances. The group received no payment for digital downloads under their EMI contract. Yorke said: “In terms of digital income, we’ve made more money out of this record than out of all the other Radiohead albums put together.”

		<p>Here is an interview with Thom and Jonny from 1996. It's really quite a fascinating and humorous read. For example, Thom explains why he's fascinated with car accidents (Airbag, Killer Cars, Stupid Car):

<blockquote><p>"Oh, OK. Why are there so many references to cars? Well, I'll tell you why. It's because when I was younger, my parents moved to this house, which was a long long way from Oxford, and I was just at the age where I wanted to go out the whole time. I used to have this one car, and I very nearly killed myself in it one morning, and gave my girlfriend at the time really bad whiplash in an accident. I was 17. Hadn't slept the night before. Anyway, eventually, my dad bought me another car, a Morris Minor, you know, and when you drove around corners in it, the driver door used to fly open. Um, and I'd only do 50 miles an hour, and on the road that went from my house to Oxford, there was fucking maniacs all the time, people who would drive 100 miles an hour to work, and I was in the Morris Minor, and it was like standing in the middle of the road with no protection at all. So I just gradually became emotionally tied up in this whole thing."</p></blockquote>
